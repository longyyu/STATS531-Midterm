# An Analysis of Lake Michigan-Huron Water Levels, 1980-2021


## Introduction

In recent years, there has been a growing concern over steadily rising water levels in the Great Lakes and the resulting property damage and shoreline erosion. As such, environmental scientists have been investigating the potential causes and implications of high water in the Great Lakes, tying this into the larger conversation about climate change.

In this project, we considered the variation of water levels in Lake Michigan-Huron over the time period 1980-2020 and conducted an ARIMA analysis of the data. Our goals were to identify if there is a general trend that could explain the noticeable increase in water levels in the past 10 years, as well as model the relationship between water levels in different lakes - specifically, Lake Michigan and Lake Erie.

## Outline
- trend fitting with polynomial regression
- analysis of seasonality
- SARMA / ARIMA model fitting
- model diagnostics and goodness of fit
- cross-comparison between lakes

## Summary of Results
-  Lake Michigan water levels are highly non-stationary, varying wildly and erratically
-  the recent rise in water levels is much sharper than in past decades
-  water levels are within historical variation: the mid-1980s had comparable lake levels to today
-  Lake Michigan's water levels tend to lag Lake Erie's by about a month
-  Lake Erie's water levels have fluctuated less than Lake Michigan's
